CHANGELOG:
    bootstrap_local_kind
        changed commons.env name which is navarcos management cluster specific in kind-navarcos-commons.env
        NAVARCOS_DOMAIN_SUFFIX variable has different behavior now since we start using metallb loadbalancer to fix keycloak changing IP following by kind node ip changes
        add metallb installation on bootstrap local kind (navarcos management cluster) which is needed for keycloak and kubevirt provider with kube cloud controller
        removed curl reference to yaml manifest, loaded from local ./bootstrap_yaml
        removed settings from kind_cluster.config.yaml extralabels for nginx ingress, and extraportmapping since we manage with loadbalancer now.
        removed   "domainSuffix: .127.0.0.1.nip.io" from values.yaml since we using docker network bridge with local IP dinamically obtained.
        added util function to check controlplane number RAFT requirements (etcd)
        added util function progressbar to add tui about download ubuntu image and datavolume cloning
    create_clusters
        removed all creation specific script (kubevirt, docker, kubevirtext)
        removed interactive script
        created a single script that manage all the options (interactive, auto, partial-auto)
        created values.environment.yaml to provide defaults for specific environment (kubevirt, docker, kubevirtext)
        fixed non working users login through OIDC:
            fixed keycloak realm creation redirectUris (localhost:8000, localhost:18000)
            fixed ca-certificate navarcos-ca on apiserver definition using oidc-ca-file and mounting certificate (docker on clusterclass, kubevirt on controlplanedefinition)
        removed OIDC references on kubevirtext implementation since apiserver cannot reach keycloak into kind navarcos.
not-fixed:
        in kubevirtext implementation, keycloak realm parameter is still present in defaults and interactive mode, but it's useless since we do not create realm for kubevirtext (apiserver cannot reach kind keycloak)
